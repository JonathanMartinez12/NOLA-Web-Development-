4. **Results-Focused**: Emphasis on leads, calls, and customers

- Monthly payment feels manageable vs $5k-$8k upfront
- Focus on ROI (leads & calls) justifies monthly cost
- Clear cancellation policy reduces commitment anxiety

**Value Perception:**
- They see the website is worth $3k-$8k
- They're "only" paying for ongoing SEO
- Monthly cost seems small compared to website value
- Emphasizes this is an investment, not an expense
